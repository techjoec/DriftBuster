# MSIX Packaging Assets

Place production-ready PNG logo assets in this directory before running `scripts/package_msix.ps1`:

- `Square44x44Logo.png`
- `Square150x150Logo.png`
- `Wide310x150Logo.png`
- `StoreLogo.png`

The files must be 32-bit PNGs with transparency preserved. The `Square44x44Logo` should include the safe zone padding required by the Windows guidelines.
