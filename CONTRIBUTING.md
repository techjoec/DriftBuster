## 1. Code of Conduct

All participants must follow the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).  
Harassment, hostility, or illegal behavior will result in permanent exclusion from the project.

## 2. Contribution Overview

- **All contributions** are accepted under **Apache 2.0**.
- **No exceptions.** If you cannot legally relicense your contribution under Apache 2.0, you **must not submit** it.
- **All submissions are subject to provenance review** for third-party material, including text, code, schemas, and binary assets.

---

## 3. Provenance & Legal Integrity

To maintain zero IP creep, all contributors must ensure:

### 3.1 You Own or Can License All Code You Submit
- Only contribute **original code you authored**, or
- Code from **third-party permissive sources** (MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, CC0, MPL 2.0).

### 3.2 Explicitly Forbidden Sources
Do **not** submit code, snippets, or data from:
- GPL or AGPL licensed projects (copyleft risk).
- Closed-source SDKs, decompiled binaries, or reverse-engineered materials.
- Any vendor, partner, or employer‚Äôs internal or proprietary repositories.
- Any AI-generated code that includes **copied or verbatim excerpts** from copyrighted works (check provenance via tool logs if applicable).

### 3.3 Documentation & Configuration
- When describing vendor formats (e.g., `.ini`, `.xml`, `.config`), base on **publicly observable behavior** only.
- Do **not** reproduce, quote, or include vendor documentation verbatim.
- Include a provenance comment such as:
  ```csharp
  // Derived from publicly documented behavior, not vendor source.
  ```

## 4. File Headers & Licensing

Every file **must** begin with:
```csharp
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
// Copyright (c) 2025 TechJoe and contributors
```

If adapted from permissive code:
```csharp
// Portions derived from ProjectName (MIT License, ¬© YYYY OriginalAuthor)
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

- Apache 2.0, MIT, BSD, MPL 2.0, CC0, or Public Domain.

### ‚ùå Disallowed

## 6. Modules & Formatters

- External modules and formatters **must include their own LICENSE** file.
- Modules interacting through DriftBuster‚Äôs public API may use permissive licenses only.
- Closed-source modules may exist but **cannot statically link** or embed DriftBuster code.
- All module metadata must declare:
  ```json

    "provenance": "authored-original"
  }
  ```

## 7. Contribution Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | Fork and clone the repo |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Create a feature branch (`feature/<topic>`) |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | Run `dotnet format` and all unit tests |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Verify SPDX headers and licenses |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | Submit PR with detailed provenance statement |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | Maintainers review build + legal scan results |

Each PR **must** include a short provenance note, e.g.:
> ‚ÄúAll changes are original or derived from Apache-2.0 sources.  
> No third-party proprietary material included.‚Äù

## 8. Security & Privacy

- No telemetry or analytics submissions are permitted without user opt-in.
- Do not include any private keys, credentials, or internal URLs.
- Report vulnerabilities privately to **security@techjoe.work**.

---

## 9. Compliance Automation

Continuous Integration (CI) runs:
- `reuse lint` ‚Äî verifies SPDX headers and license compliance.
- `dotnet test` ‚Äî executes functional suite.
- `detect-secrets` ‚Äî scans for credentials or API keys.
- `pip-licenses` / `npm ls --json` ‚Äî audits dependency trees (where applicable).

PRs failing any compliance step will **not** be merged.

## 10. Enforcement

Violations trigger escalating actions:
1. PR rejection with remediation guidance.
2. Maintainer review for deliberate or repeated infringement.
3. Permanent ban for intentional IP or license violations.
