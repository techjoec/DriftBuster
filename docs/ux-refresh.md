# UX Refresh Notes

This file captures the working notes for the current Avalonia UX polish effort so that future
iterations have a concrete baseline.

## Responsive Server Layout (P1)
- Host cards moved from a fixed `WrapPanel` into an `ItemsRepeater` using `UniformGridLayout`.
- Min/max sizing keeps each card between 320 px and 440 px wide while the layout adapts at
  1280, 1440, and 1920 px breakpoints without gutter collapse.
- Validation summary surfaces through a shared tooltip/automation label that reports "All roots
  ready", "pending validation", or specific error text (duplicate/relative paths, missing roots).
- Focus-visible styles for `Button`, `ComboBox`, `TextBox`, and `ToggleSwitch` were added to
  the theme dictionary to give keyboard navigation a high-contrast outline.
- Access keys on the execution command strip: **Alt+R** (Run all), **Alt+M** (Run missing),
  **Alt+C** (Cancel). Confirmed Narrator announces them with the new focus outlines.

## Catalog & Drilldown Productivity (P2)
- Catalog `DataGrid` now provides click-to-sort headers across Config, Drift, Coverage, Format,
  Severity, and Updated columns. The current descriptor is cached inside the session snapshot so
  it restores with the rest of the multi-server state.
- Drilldown headers gained a metadata strip: format, baseline host label/ID, drift count, and
  provenance. This keeps analysts from scrolling before deciding whether to escalate a config.
- Added a **Copy JSON** action alongside the export pair. It uses the sanitised payload already
  handed to the export path, removes the need to save a temp file, and fires a toast/status entry
  so there is evidence in the activity timeline.

## Validation & Testing Checkpoints
- Headless tests cover responsive host layout, catalog sort persistence, and the new clipboard
  command. Ensure `dotnet test gui/DriftBuster.Gui.Tests/DriftBuster.Gui.Tests.csproj` stays green
  after any UX iteration.
- Future work: capture 1280/1440/1920 px snapshots under `artifacts/ux/` once the automated
  screenshot harness lands. Track this follow-up in PLAN.md when the tooling is ready.

Last updated: 2025-02-14 â€” regenerate after any notable UX change.

## Asset Provenance
- Store UI screenshots under `docs/assets/` with filenames that encode resolution, theme, and feature (e.g. `20250214-server-grid-1440px-dark.png`).
- Record each capture in the benchmark log or design notes with source resolution, theme, and data set used.
- Link assets back to the benchmark entry or doc section that motivated the capture so refresh cycles stay traceable.

## Notifications & Timeline (P3)
- Toast host now draws from tokenised colours/icons defined in `Notifications.axaml`, caps the visible stack at three cards, and exposes an overflow expander with counts.
- Timeline filter adds **Warnings** and **Exports** options; selection is persisted alongside session state (`ServerSelectionCache.activity_filter`).
- Export and copy actions log with `ActivityCategory.Export`, enabling the dedicated filter without string matching.
