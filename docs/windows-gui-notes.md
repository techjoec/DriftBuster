# Windows GUI Notes

Updated audit of the Avalonia starter plus earlier research log. For a user-facing walkthrough see `docs/windows-gui-guide.md`.

## Current Base Assets (2025-10 audit)

- **Avalonia shell**: `gui/DriftBuster.Gui` targets `net8.0` with Avalonia 11.2.0. The refined header couples navigation, backend health, and theme controls in a compact strip; views swap via `CurrentView` bindings.
- **Backend library**: `gui/DriftBuster.Backend` hosts shared diff, hunt, and run-profile helpers consumed by both the GUI and the PowerShell module.
- **Execution contract**: Operations run on background tasks, returning the same JSON payloads previously emitted by the Python helper so the UI bindings stay untouched.
- **UI snapshot**: Diff view validates inputs, renders plan/metadata cards, and offers a copy-raw-JSON action. Hunt view adds directory picker, status messaging, and card-style findings with token badges. The multi-server screen now uses tidy host cards, side-by-side execution/timeline panels, and a lean guidance banner to keep the orchestration workflow focused.
- **Responses**: Diff returns `plan` + `metadata` describing the selected files; Hunt returns filtered hit lists using the built-in rule set.
- **Assets**: `Directory.Build.props` centralises net8.0 defaults; `gui/DriftBuster.Gui/Assets/app.ico` holds the DrB red/black logo baked into the WinExe manifest.

## Host Dependencies

- **.NET SDK 8.0.x** installed locally for restore, build, run, and publish steps.
- **Optional tooling**: Avalonia preview support in editor (Rider, VS Code extension) improves XAML edits but is not required.
- **Runtime checks**: Confirm `dotnet --list-sdks` includes 8.x before running the GUI.
- **NuGet footprint**: Restore succeeds with Avalonia 11.2.0 packages (`Avalonia`, `Avalonia.Desktop`, `Avalonia.Fonts.Inter`, `Avalonia.Themes.Fluent`, `Avalonia.Diagnostics`). No FluentAvalonia dependency is required.
- **Assets**: `Assets/app.ico` already contains the DrB badge; replace it with design-approved artwork before shipping installers.

## Integration Milestones

1. Port the Avalonia project, bridge module, and build props into the repo while preserving relative paths.
2. Replace sample bridge handlers with real JSON responses wired to `Driftbuster.Backend` helpers.
3. Document GUI launch instructions plus dependency checklist in the main README or companion doc. Include how registry scan outputs (`registry_scan.json`) appear alongside file-based results when present.
4. Add UX polish: accent/outline button variants, larger hit targets, table/card refinements, backend status dot, and theme switching.
5. Prepare Windows packaging guidance (`dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true`) once features settle.
6. Compiled bindings remain disabled (`AvaloniaUseCompiledBindingsByDefault=false`); add `x:DataType` hints later if we re-enable them.

## Packaging Quickstart

Follow the restore + publish flow below so each bundle lands with reproducible file hashes and matching evidence in `artifacts/gui-packaging/`.

1. Restore & compile once per session: `dotnet restore` then `dotnet build -c Release gui/DriftBuster.Gui/DriftBuster.Gui.csproj`.
2. Snapshot the git commit (`git rev-parse HEAD > artifacts/gui-packaging/commit.txt`) before publishing so downstream evidence ties back to source.

### Portable ZIP workflow (host runtime required)

1. Publish:
   ```powershell
   dotnet publish gui/DriftBuster.Gui/DriftBuster.Gui.csproj `
     -c Release -r win-x64 `
     /p:PublishSingleFile=true `
     /p:SelfContained=false `
     /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
   ```
2. Compress the publish folder (`publish/`) into `DriftBuster.Gui-portable-win-x64.zip` and store it under `artifacts/gui-packaging/portable/` (create the folder when capturing release evidence).
3. Copy `MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe` beside the zip; bundle both into the operator hand-off package.
4. Capture SHA256 hashes for the zip + WebView2 installer via `Get-FileHash` (PowerShell) and record them in `artifacts/gui-packaging/portable/hashes.txt` (or append the values to `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-framework-dependent.sha256` to mirror the tracked evidence format).
5. Note the required pre-installed dependencies (host must have .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime + WebView2) in the release notes.

### Self-contained bundle workflow (ships .NET runtime)

1. Publish:
   ```powershell
   dotnet publish gui/DriftBuster.Gui/DriftBuster.Gui.csproj `
     -c Release -r win-x64 `
     /p:PublishSingleFile=true `
     /p:SelfContained=true `
     /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
   ```
2. Rename the single-file output to `DriftBuster.Gui-selfcontained.exe` and stage it under `artifacts/gui-packaging/selfcontained/` (create the folder if it does not exist yet).
3. Bundle the WebView2 offline installer plus `NOTICE` artefacts in the same folder so operators can deploy without internet access.
4. Capture SHA256 hashes for every staged file and append to `artifacts/gui-packaging/selfcontained/hashes.txt` (or reuse `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-self-contained.sha256`).
5. Verify launch on a clean Windows VM (no .NET runtime installed) and log the console trace to `artifacts/gui-packaging/selfcontained/first-launch.log`.

For each flavour, append the executed commands, hash outputs, and validation notes to `notes/dev-host-prep.md` so packaging evidence stays centralised. The current repository snapshot captures both publish transcripts and hashes in `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-framework-dependent.log`, `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-framework-dependent.sha256`, `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-self-contained.log`, and `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-self-contained.sha256`.

## Manual Smoke Checklist

- Follow `notes/checklists/gui-smoke.md` for the current walkthrough (ping core, run diff/hunt, validate error handling, and confirm backend shutdown).

## Headless UI Testing (2025-10 refresh)

- **Guarded initialisation**: `Program.EnsureHeadless(Func<AppBuilder, AppBuilder>?)` now prevents duplicate Avalonia setup by reusing the first headless instance. The fixture in `.gui/DriftBuster.Gui.Tests/Ui/HeadlessFixture.cs` pipes in `UseHeadless` so repeated calls stay safe.
- **Shared collection & dispatcher facts**: `[Collection(HeadlessCollection.Name)]` still coordinates Avalonia access, while `[AvaloniaFact]` ensures dispatcher-bound tests (navigation, drilldown, converters, session cache, compact view instantiation) run on the UI thread.
- **tmux command shape**: Run GUI tests inside tmux to keep sessions responsive, e.g. `tmux new -d -s codexcli-ui 'cd /github/repos/DriftBuster && dotnet test gui/DriftBuster.Gui.Tests/DriftBuster.Gui.Tests.csproj'`. Capture logs with `|& tee artifacts/<session>.log` when reproducing issues.
- **Focused filters**: Use `--filter 'FullyQualifiedName~MainWindowUiTests'` (or the other class names) for quick iteration, then finish with full Debug/Release passes and `-p:EnableAvaloniaXamlCompilation=true` to mirror release builds.
- **Diagnostics**: `AvaloniaSetupInspection.LogSetupState` (run with `AVALONIA_INSPECT=1`) logs style dictionaries into `artifacts/codexcli-inspect.log` for tracing resource registration order when investigating future regressions.

> **Still useful:** Historical research content below remains for context on alternative stacks and packaging decisions.

## Windows GUI Exploration (Future Work)

Research log for a potential Windows-first shell once the CLI outputs stabilise.
Active user requirements are tracked in the status log (`notes/status/gui-research.md#user-requirements`).

## Candidate Frameworks

**Current decision (A19.1): prioritise WinUI 3 for the shipping Windows shell, keep Tkinter/PySimpleGUI research as lightweight tooling notes, and treat Electron as a future HTML-heavy contingency.** See `artifacts/gui-packaging/framework-evaluation-2025-10-25.json` for the structured snapshot backing this matrix.

| Framework | Why we would pick it | Key blockers | Packaging notes | Licence callouts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK** | Fluent native shell, built-in WebView2 keeps HTML diff rendering first-class, aligns with Microsoft tooling most operators already have. | Requires MSIX tooling (Windows 10 1809+), Visual Studio workload heavier than dotnet-only projects, WebView2 runtime must be staged for offline installs. | Default to MSIX with optional self-contained `.NET` publish for offline deployments; bundle WebView2 Evergreen installer in distribution folder. | MIT SDK + WebView2 redistribution notice; add Windows App SDK, WinUI, and WebView2 runtime to NOTICE bundle. |
| **Tkinter** | Ships with CPython, very small footprint, fast to script maintenance utilities. | No native WebView for HTML reports, UI dated for production shell without major effort. | Portable zip with embedded CPython covers offline hosts; MSIX adds little beyond packaging convenience. | Include Python PSF licence plus Tcl/Tk notice in NOTICE directory. |
| **PySimpleGUI (Tk flavour)** | Higher-level layout wrappers on top of Tkinter, minimal code to build dialogs and wizards. | Still inherits Tkinter rendering limits, LGPLv3 obligations if modified. | Same portable zip approach as Tkinter; document source-offer steps if distributing customised wheel. | NOTICE must reference PySimpleGUI LGPLv3 text and source access location. |
| **Electron** | Chromium renderer unlocks fully interactive HTML/JS dashboards and deep telemetry overlays. | Sizeable download (~100â€¯MB), Node.js toolchain, extra security hardening for offline-friendly builds. | MSIX or Squirrel packages; ensure hashed offline bundle with signed Node modules. | Enumerate bundled npm licences in NOTICE and track updates rigorously. |

Update the status log (`notes/status/gui-research.md`) when evaluating new candidates so this section stays synced.

## Packaging & Distribution Plan

_Execution queue:_ see `CLOUDTASKS.md` area A19 for the current packaging backlog.

- **MSIX**
  - Natural fit for WinUI/Electron bundles; delivers auto-updates and clean install/uninstall.
  - Needs code-signing certificate and explicit capability declarations (file system access, WebView2 runtime).
- **Portable ZIP**
  - Provide zip archive with executable + assets; supports offline admins.
- **Bundled runtime**
  - Ship the .NET runtime when targeting hosts without it (`/p:SelfContained=true`).
  - Record third-party notices alongside binaries.
- **WebView2 Evergreen redistribution**
  - Bundle the offline Evergreen installer (`MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe`) beside the GUI publish output.
  - During packaging, script `MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe /silent /install` before first GUI launch; emit installer logs to `artifacts/gui-packaging/` for traceability.
  - After installation, verify `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}` exists and record the `pv` value in release notes so operators can confirm runtime parity offline.
- **Update Channel**
  - Manual updates: publish checksum + version in release notes until automation is approved.

## Evidence index (A19.6)

| Evidence | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework-dependent publish transcript | `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-framework-dependent.log` | Records the exact command output for the portable ZIP workflow. |
| Framework-dependent hash | `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-framework-dependent.sha256` | Verifies the single-file portable binary shipped in that workflow. |
| Self-contained publish transcript | `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-self-contained.log` | Captures the command output for the self-contained bundle. |
| Self-contained hash | `artifacts/gui-packaging/publish-self-contained.sha256` | Confirms the signed binary that includes the .NET runtime. |
| Framework decision matrix | `artifacts/gui-packaging/framework-evaluation-2025-10-25.json` | Machine-readable rationale aligning with the narrative matrix in this doc. |
| Windows packaging smoke log | `artifacts/gui-packaging/windows-smoke-tests-2025-02-14.json` | Evidence of Windows 10/11 installer validation runs referenced in the status notes. |
| Packaging evidence guide | `artifacts/gui-packaging/README.md` | Step-by-step instructions mirroring the captured transcripts and hash commands. |

Keep new publish runs in sync with this table so operators can audit the exact evidence set without guessing at filenames or directories.

## Distribution & Licensing Notes

- Maintain a `NOTICE` file covering .NET dependencies, Avalonia packages, and any auxiliary tooling. Reference the current template stored alongside the packaging evidence so regenerated bundles inherit the same baseline.
- Confirm WebView2 Evergreen redistributable terms when embedding reports.
- Avoid auto-downloading dependencies at runtime; ship vetted binaries to keep supply chain tight.
- Require offline activation path so security teams can inspect builds before deployment.
- Generate SHA256 manifests for every bundle (see the checked-in `publish-*.sha256` files in `artifacts/gui-packaging/`) and mirror the manifest inside the operator hand-off package.
- Capture install/uninstall transcripts per flavour (e.g., `publish-*.log` in `artifacts/gui-packaging/`) and record signing certificate details (thumbprint, expiry, issuer) in the legal review checklist.
- Provide certificate chain exports under `artifacts/gui-packaging/certificates/` so operators can import signing roots on isolated hosts before installing MSIX packages. Create the folder on first run if it does not yet exist in the evidence tree.

### Offline activation guidance (A19.5.1)

1. Stage the portable zip or self-contained bundle plus `MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe` on a removable drive; include `NOTICE` and hash manifest files so operators can audit contents offline.
2. On the target host, validate hashes with `Get-FileHash <file> -Algorithm SHA256` and compare against the recorded values before extracting or installing anything.
3. Run the WebView2 installer with `MicrosoftEdgeWebView2RuntimeInstallerX64.exe /silent /install` while disconnected from the network; capture `%TEMP%\MicrosoftEdgeWebView2Setup.log` and move it into `C:\ProgramData\DriftBuster\Logs\webview2-offline.log` for archival.
4. Extract the portable zip (or copy the self-contained executable) into `C:\ProgramData\DriftBuster\App\` and ensure read/write permissions are limited to administrators.
5. Launch the GUI once with `DriftBuster.Gui*.exe --log-file C:\ProgramData\DriftBuster\Logs\first-boot-offline.log` to generate the initial cache while offline; archive the log alongside the hash manifest.
6. Document the activation steps and log locations in `notes/dev-host-prep.md` so subsequent operators can replay the process without re-downloading assets.
7. Run `python -m scripts.offline_compliance_audit artifacts/gui-packaging` and archive the resulting report alongside the logs so compliance reviewers can verify evidence without internet access.

## Data Flow & UX Outline

- **Input Sources**: Consume generated HTML reports for rich rendering and JSON summaries for metadata panels.
- **Workflow**: Prompt user to select snapshot bundle â†’ parse JSON metadata â†’ display HTML diff alongside metadata sidebar.
- **Minimal Features**:
  - Load snapshot/scan outputs from local disk.
  - Toggle between HTML diff view and metadata table.
  - Highlight sensitive tokens flagged by redaction hooks.
  - Provide quick links to open source file paths in default editor (read-only).
- **Extensibility Hooks**: Keep data loading modular so CLI continues to own scanning logic.

## Manual Testing Expectations (Future)

- Smoke test zipped build on clean Windows VM (no Python installed) to confirm bundled runtime works.
- Validate GUI handles large HTML reports (>5 MB) without freezing; note memory footprint.
- Confirm JSON metadata parsing tolerates missing optional fields and surfaces errors via dialog.

## Compliance & Accessibility Checklist

- Legal Guardrails: Never embed vendor logos or proprietary sample content; rely on neutral icons.
- Security: Store recent files list in memory only; avoid writing cache files unless explicitly configured.
- Accessibility: Target keyboard navigation, high-contrast theme, and screen-reader labels for critical controls.
  1. Launch packaged build on Windows 11 VM with stable Narrator + Inspect versions logged in the accessibility evidence file.
  2. Start Narrator (`Win + Ctrl + Enter`) before opening the DriftBuster shell so focus events are captured from the splash screen.
  3. Tab through server selection and drilldown views; record any unlabeled controls or incorrect announcements.
  4. Run `inspect.exe` from the Windows SDK, attach to the DriftBuster window, and capture `Name`, `AutomationId`, and `HelpText` for critical controls.
  5. Switch to High Contrast mode (Windows Settings â†’ Accessibility â†’ Contrast Themes) and repeat Inspect sweeps to document contrast ratio readings.
  6. Store transcripts, tool versions, and screenshots in `artifacts/gui-accessibility/` for auditability.
- Privacy: Ensure redacted tokens remain masked in the UI and exports.
- Documentation: Keep safeguards aligned with `docs/legal-safeguards.md` when drafting user guidance.
