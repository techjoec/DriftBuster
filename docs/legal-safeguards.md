# Legal Safeguards

We keep the project lightweight and respect other creators:

1. **No vendor or app names**
   - Use neutral labels in docs, fixtures, and examples.
   - Replace real product names with generic placeholders.
2. **Universal formats only**
   - Focus on format-level behaviour; skip heuristics tied to branded apps.
   - Keep detector metadata generic so it applies across ecosystems.
3. **No DRM or binary cracking**
   - Do not import encrypted, DRM-protected, or proprietary binaries.
   - Skip tasks that involve reverse engineering closed formats.
4. **No reverse-engineered IP**
   - Build samples from public information or original work only.
   - Avoid copying configuration fragments that could expose private systems.

These guardrails cover every feature, note, and capture helper.

## HOLD Exit Briefing

- Check `notes/status/hold-log.md#decision-ready-summary` before resuming reporting work.
- Confirm the sample list in `docs/testing-strategy.md#hold-exit-checklist-hooks` sticks to the rules above and stays format-universal.
- Record HOLD clearance in the status log when the guardrails still hold true.
