## Manual Session Notes (A6.2.2/A6.2.3)
- Ran packaged multi-server rehearsal focusing on persistence and diff planner toggles.
- Confirmed restart retained six run profiles and reloaded cached diff plans without drift.
- Captured log transcript for bundle and flagged evidence path in GUI research notes.
- Screen capture reference pending attachment; placeholder noted in evidence bundle for follow-up.

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Attach .NET Cobertura summary once exporter runs in next sweep.
- Capture final GUI screenshots for docs refresh (A6.3.x).
- Attach multi-server session screen capture once export completes.
- Schedule accessibility regression rerun prior to release candidate sign-off.
