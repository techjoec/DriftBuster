# DriftBuster 0.0.3 (Draft)

## Core
- Add `registry-live` format plugin to detect registry scan definition files.
- Introduce Windows Registry live scan utilities (enumerate apps, suggest roots, search).
- Offline runner can execute `registry_scan` sources and package results.

## Formats
- Registry Live: JSON and YAML manifest detection with `registry_scan` token/keywords/patterns; metadata captured for downstream tools.

## GUI
- Surfaces `registry_scan.json` outputs (when present) alongside file-based findings.

## Installer
- None.

## Tooling
- Avoid test import collision by forcing local `scripts` package during pytest collection.

## Notes
- Windows-only functionality for live registry scans; non-Windows hosts skip gracefully.
- See docs/registry.md for API and offline-runner usage.
