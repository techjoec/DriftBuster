# HOLD Check-ins

> **Gate:** Do not begin Areas A8 and beyond until this log records explicit user approval lifting HOLD.
> (Decision-ready prerequisites reaffirmed 2025-10-24T20:28:06Z; awaiting final go-ahead.)

## Weekly Check-ins
### Week of 2025-10-24
- 2025-10-24T20:28:06Z — Replayed HOLD exit checklist: confirmed `docs/legal-safeguards.md#hold-exit-briefing` neutral language
  guidance still matches the current sample catalog.
- 2025-10-24T20:28:06Z — Rehearsed manual compile/lint workflow (compileall + pycodestyle targets) and captured transcript in
  `artifacts/hold-exit/compile-lint.txt`.
- 2025-10-24T20:28:06Z — Verified `scripts/capture.py` defaults (root glob `**/*`, output dir `captures/`, placeholder
  `[REDACTED]`) remain aligned with the hold exit packet in `docs/testing-strategy.md#hold-exit-checklist-hooks`.

### Week of 2025-10-11
- Decision logged: user opted to keep reporting work (A8) on HOLD and continue core + XML iterations only.
- Need confirmation that existing sample catalog is sufficient for whichever path is chosen.
- Clarify whether manual lint/test policy changes are expected before A8 work proceeds.
- Status log now documents GUI user requirements for review (`notes/status/gui-research.md#user-requirements`).

### Decision-Ready Summary

| Capture manifest workflow | Decision-ready 2025-10-24; defaults confirmed neutral | Validated `scripts/capture.py` defaults vs. `docs/testing-strategy.md#hold-exit-checklist-hooks`; transcripts archived under `artifacts/hold-exit/`. |

## Logging Procedure
1. Append a new weekly section when questions change or a new calendar week starts.
2. Record inbound responses in the table immediately; include date, short summary, and resulting action.
3. Only mark HOLD cleared when the response explicitly authorises starting A8 (update the gate notice accordingly).
