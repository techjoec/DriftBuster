# Status: Areas A1–A6

## Achievements
- **A1 Core Detector Stabilisation:** Sampling guardrails, error context, and manual lint/test policy landed; detector handles mixed fixture sets without uncaught exceptions.
- **A2–A4 Hunts & Formats:** Hunt-mode adjustments, YAML/INI refinements, and binary guardrails rolled in alongside updated manual validation notes.
- **A5 Reporting Foundations:** Docs and checklists now steer manual reviewers through detection outputs, redaction safeguards, and contributor expectations.
- **A6 XML Coverage:** `.config` role detection, namespace-aware variant tagging, and manual verification logs are in place with docs pointing at remaining backlog work.
- **A4 XML Variant Coverage:** Neutral `web-config`/`app-config`/`machine-config` slugs confirmed with transform metadata; see `notes/snippets/xml-config-diffs.md` and CLI log `notes/snippets/xml-cli-run-2025-10-14.txt`.
- **A7 Hunt Integration Bridge:** Dynamic token plan transforms (`metadata.plan_transform` + `build_plan_transforms`) keep the
  A7 hardening outcome discoverable from this status roll-up.

## Gaps & Follow-ups
- Reporting adapters (A8) remain blocked pending HOLD release; diff design and adapters are queued but untouched.
- Capture/comparison automation (A9) and token workflows (A10) depend on A8 decisions and are currently idle.
- Profile drift automation beyond manual scripts is deferred; existing helpers focus on manual diffing.
- Diff blueprint staged in `src/driftbuster/core/diffing.py` to document the
  intended API without enabling runtime execution; manual snippets now log
  planned kwargs instead of invoking reporting helpers automatically.

## HOLD Exit Readiness Addendum
- **Reporting surface:** User confirmed A8 stays paused; continue documenting prerequisites in `CLOUDTASKS.md` area A10 and hold adapter work.
- **Capture pipeline:** `scripts/capture.py` remains manual. Need confirmation that manifest defaults match the neutral sample policy in `docs/legal-safeguards.md#hold-exit-briefing`.
- **Manual gate:** Continue running the compile/lint commands from `notes/checklists/core-scan.md` before any reporting/capture changes. Automation (pytest/mypy) stays deferred until HOLD exit grants permission.
- **Token catalog:** New JSON detector surfaces `structured-settings-json`; reviewers should use `notes/snippets/token-catalog.py` to hash hunt excerpts and update `notes/checklists/token-approval.md` before closing approvals.

## Testing & Lint Readiness
Manual validation only, per guardrails:

```bash
python -m compileall src
pycodestyle src
python -m driftbuster.cli fixtures/config --json
```

- Tracked commands originate from `docs/testing-strategy.md` and the profile/hunt checklists.
- Manual outcomes logged in `notes/checklists/*`; no automated CI configured.

### Sample Config Catalog
| Format | Baseline sample | Drift sample | Storage pointer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.config` web/app | Sanitised web-framework config (public doc example) | Synthetic transform with XDT diff | External share noted in `docs/testing-strategy.md` sample catalog |
| Generic XML (manifest/resx/xaml) | Open-source project templates | Mutated namespace variant | Same external catalog entry (XML row) |
| Profiles (`ProfileStore`) | Mock profile bundle under `notes/snippets/profile-summary-diff.py` inputs | Duplicate-ID mutation script output | Recreate via snippet instructions; no repo storage |
| Hunt fixtures | Public YAML/INI configs referenced in `docs/format-playbook.md` | Token-swapped copies generated per checklist | External catalog, path recorded in manual test log |

### Lint/Testing Policy Outlook
- Current policy: manual compile/lint plus targeted detector runs before each change; outcomes logged in checklists.
- Desired follow-up (post-HOLD): reintroduce pytest and mypy gates once A8 reporting surface is stable and fixtures expand, matching TODOs already tracked in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.
